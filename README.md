# Cyber Security Internship – Task 11

## Task Title
Phishing Attack Simulation & Detection

## Objective
To understand phishing attacks, simulate a phishing scenario safely, identify phishing indicators, and learn detection and prevention techniques.

## Overview
Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information. This task focuses on awareness-based phishing simulation and detection without targeting real users.

## Types of Phishing Covered
- Email Phishing
- Spear Phishing
- Smishing (SMS Phishing)
- Vishing (Voice Phishing)
- Clone Phishing

## Phishing Simulation
- A sample phishing email was created for learning purposes
- No real users were targeted
- No credentials were collected
- Simulation was performed only for awareness and documentation

## Phishing Indicators
- Urgent or threatening language
- Suspicious sender addresses
- Unexpected links or attachments
- Spelling and grammar mistakes
- Requests for login or personal information

## Detection Techniques
- Verifying sender authenticity
- Inspecting links before clicking
- Analyzing email headers
- User awareness and training

## Prevention Techniques
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Use spam and email filtering
- Avoid clicking unknown links
- Conduct security awareness training

## Deliverables
- Phishing Attack Simulation & Detection Report (PDF)

## Outcome
Gained awareness of phishing attack methods, detection techniques, and prevention strategies to reduce social engineering risks.
